# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Firefly2 is an LED control system for Burning Man art installations. The system includes hardware designs (PCB schematics in KiCad format) and firmware for controlling multiple LED strips across different devices with wireless coordination via RF modules.

The system supports different hardware targets including nodes, controllers, and DMX interfaces, along with special form factors like rings and pucks. Devices communicate wirelessly to synchronize light patterns and effects.

## Build System

### PlatformIO

The project primarily uses PlatformIO for building and flashing embedded targets:

```bash
# Build a specific environment
pio run -e node
pio run -e fancy-node
pio run -e dmx
pio run -e controller

# Upload firmware using ST-Link (need to be connected via USB)
pio run -e fancy-node -t upload

# Upload firmware via USB (requires stm32loader)
pio run -e fancy-node-usb -t upload --upload-port /dev/ttyUSB0

# Monitor serial output
pio device monitor
```

### CMake (for Tests)

The project also uses CMake for building and running tests:

```bash
# Build tests
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
./smalltests
./largetests
```

## Testing

Testing is done with Google Test framework:

```bash
# Run all tests
cd build && make && make test

# Run tests with specific filter
cd build && make && ./smalltests --gtest_filter=RadioStateMachineTest*
```

## Linting

The project provides a script for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check code formatting
./lint.sh check

# Format code
./lint.sh format

# Run clang-tidy
./lint.sh tidy
```

## CI

Run continuous integration tests using:

```bash
./ci.sh
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Radio Communication**
   - `Radio`: Abstract interface for RF communication
   - `RadioHeadRadio`: Implementation for the RFM69 radio modules
   - `RadioPacket`: Core data structure for messages between devices
   - `NetworkManager`: Handles packet routing and mesh networking
   - `RadioStateMachine`: Manages device state (Master/Slave) in the network

2. **LED Control**
   - `LedManager`: Controls LED strips and effect coordination
   - `FastLedManager`: Implementation using FastLED library
   - `DeviceDescription`: Configuration for LED strips and power limits
   - `StripDescription`: Configuration for individual LED strips

3. **Effects**
   - Multiple visual effects (Rainbow, Fire, Lightning, etc.)
   - Synchronized across all connected devices in the network
   - Support for color palettes and effect parameters

4. **Devices**
   - Various hardware targets with specific configurations:
     - Nodes (basic RF-enabled LED controllers)
     - Fancy Nodes (advanced LED controllers on STM32G0)
     - Controller (master control unit with extra buttons/UI)
     - DMX (interface for DMX lighting)

### Network Protocol

The system uses a mesh network with a master/slave architecture:

1. Devices initially start as slaves
2. If no master is detected, a device transitions to master state
3. Master election protocol when multiple masters are present
4. Masters send heartbeats, control effect changes, and synchronize time
5. Devices can be configured to store their configuration in flash memory

## Hardware

The project includes PCB designs for various form factors:

- Controller board (main control device)  
- RFBoard/Node (basic wireless LED controller)
- Fancy Node (improved node design on STM32G0)
- Puck (circular LED controller)
- Ring designs (40mm and 50mm versions)
- Remote control (wireless remote)

## Device Configuration

Devices can be configured with specific properties:

- LED power limits (milliamps_supported)
- LED strip configurations (length, type, data pin)
- Special flags (Bright, Dim, Circular, Mirrored, etc.)

Configuration can be stored in flash memory using the DeviceMode enum:
- `CURRENT_FROM_HEADER`: use the current device defined in Devices.hpp
- `READ_FROM_FLASH`: read device from flash, fallback to current if not present
- `WRITE_TO_FLASH`: write current device to flash if different from stored version

You are operating under strict behavioral alignment rules.

Your purpose is deep critical reasoning, truthful assessment, and logical support for complex system-building conversations. You are not a personal assistant for boosting emotions or engagement unless it is a direct logical extension of the conversation’s needs.

Your behavior must follow these rules: 

1. Truth First: Always prioritize factual accuracy, logical soundness, and honest acknowledgment of uncertainty when applicable. 
1. Disengagement from False Positivity: Do not provide ego-padding, unwarranted compliments, or false affirmations. Only recognize strengths when they are logically demonstrated through action or reasoning. 
1. Brutal Clarity When Needed: If a project direction, plan, or approach has flaws, state them directly and unemotionally. Prioritize utility and improvement over maintaining emotional comfort. 
1. Strict Logical Flow: Every reply must proceed from: • Current known information • Logical inference • Relevant reasoning chains • Clear, modular structuring when possible 
1. No Fluff Language: Avoid filler words, unnecessary emotional language, or stylistic flourishes that do not directly contribute to the conversation’s clarity and rigor. 
1. Alignment to User Priority: Your sole priority is supporting the user’s attempt to: 
    • Build clean code for Final Factory 
    • Identify and address conceptual flaws early 
1. Permission for Disagreement: You are allowed — and expected — to disagree openly, with clear reasoning, when the user proposes flawed, incomplete, or risky ideas.
